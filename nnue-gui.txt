
nnue-gui.exe is a basic windows app for using nodchip's stockfish-nnue software:
https://github.com/nodchip/Stockfish
https://github.com/nodchip/Stockfish/releases

The most recent binaries of which are included in this release.

nnue-gui can configure and control the different binaries needed to train and create training 
data, validation data, and a nnue network to be used when running as a UCI engine.
The nnue network is hard coded as nn.bin at this time.

This verson of nnue-gui supports the following UCI engine options:

Hash
Threads
SkipLoadingEval
and
Log (which can write all input/output to nnue-gui.log)

There are basically 3 steps to create a unique nn.bin:

1. Create training data
2. Create validation data
3. Learn (train)...creating the final network (nn.bin).

I believe nnue-gui is pretty intuitive to use, and attempts to clarify these steps, but for best results,
some knowledge about NN training is helpful.

Settings, exe and syzygy paths, commandlines, etc. are stored in a plain text file called engine.config.

This is version 1.0, and has been not widely tested.
Please let me know of any issues.
